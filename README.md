# Hangman

A simple terminal-based **Hangman** game written in Python.  
Guess the hidden word before the hangman is complete!

---

## Features
- Play directly in your terminal
- ASCII art hangman stages
- Classic rules: too many wrong guesses and the game is over!

---

## Requirements
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (any modern version should work)

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman.git
   cd hangman
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

That's it! No additional dependencies required!

## How to play

- The game will prompt you for a phrase that will become the hidden phrase (have a friend set this so you don't know what it is).
- Type a letter and press Enter to guess.
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
- Incorrect guesses add parts to the hangman.
- Win by guessing all the letters before the hangman is complete.

## Future Ideas
- Use random word and/or phrase generation to play by yourself
- Add difficulty levels
- Create word categories for random generation
- Create an ASCII art banner to display at the beginning of the game
